"""
This example demonstrates how to use the client-side-filtering feature of the
Python Cumulocity API.

Client-side filtering is _not_ part of the standard API, it is an extension
which the Python API provides which _can_ be useful in _some_ use cases. It
is important to understand, that client-side-filtering is somewhat a tool of
last resort - it becomes necessary if server-side filtering is not sufficient.
Python being Python already provides nice standard features for filtering the
query results, e.g. via list comprehension or the `filter` function. However,
sometimes it may appear easier for developers to define such a filter directly
with the `select` or `get_all` function, for example in interactive scenarios.

Client-side filters are defined for the _raw_ JSON structure. Hence, when you
want to use them you must be aware of Cumulocity's JSON data format.

By default, PyDF (Python Display Filter) expression can be specified directly
as strings. See also
https://github.com/bytebutcher/pydfql/blob/main/docs/USER_GUIDE.md#4-query-language
for details.

Performance: Hi there, optimization kids! To put it bluntly - using this
feature does most likely _not_ increase performance in any way. This is
because the actual JSON parsing will happen in any case and this is the
expensive part. So - all the illustrated methods below do only marginally
differ in speeed.

    # no DB filters) and subsequently filter the results using a standard Python
    # list comprehension:

    # The following statement will simply list "all" devices (there are no DB
    # filters) and subsequently filter the results using a PyDF expression.
    # The PyDF expression is matched against the unprocessed JSON, hence it is required
    # to understand Cumulocity's native JSON formats (but they are close to how
    # the Python API resembles it:

    # filters) and subsequently filter the results using Python matchers. There
    # is quite a list of predefined matchers (see pyc8y.model.matchers) and
    # custom ones are easy to define.

    for d in filtered_devices_3:
        print(f" - {d.name}")

    # Option 4: the client-side filtering with nested filters
    # The following statement applies the same as above, but using ridiculously
    # nested Python matchers to get the same logic. Note that we combine custom
    # filters with a PyDF expression filter.
